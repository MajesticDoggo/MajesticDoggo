## Where I explain my life story... Feel Free to Read

My real name is Carmen, but I like the sound of *Majestic* more. It all started when I was a bab- just kidding! <br>
<br> <!--honestly didn't know <br> would work until I got to this line-->
***I'll start from why I'm on GitHub in the first place.*** <br>
I've just began playing with C++ in ***Visual Studio*** about a month ago, and well, it's kinda fun... until it was not. I've always liked the hardware side of machines, but can't wrap my brain around software. I think I'm just not creative enough to make what I want through code, just like a robot doing commands n stuff, so I thought of a simple project to do. MAKE A WEBSITE!

## My Experience with "Website Developing"
In *2022*, after taking pictures of cars in Gatlinburg from an event, I wanted sort of blog to post them on and that's when web development sparked my interest. When I got back home, I booted up the ol' PC and Googled "how to make a website." Needless to say, Wix was the one options I found, and I was was like "hmm this.. could be the one," and now I regret that decision. If you want to see website I made in wix, <a href="https://majesticdoggo.wixsite.com/garage-majestic" target="_blank">here</a> *I thought it was the best thing I ever created* until I cancelled my subscription, because Wix is cool n all, but up $40 or so a month to just have a page with pictures. So, I had to get my priorities straight and asked ChatGPT "How to make a website that I can code"<!--man i love chatgpt--> It gave me a solid response, and I cracked open the *VS* and got to work. I now want a website where people could see my work, so here we are. If you happened to stumble upon this website... it doesn't really look all that crazy.

## Game Modding Experience
<p>I love modding, you love modding, everyone loves modding. The first mod I ever made was in GTA V <i>May 10th, 2019</i>—a <a href="https://www.gta5-mods.com/vehicles/nissan-350z-z33-add-on-tuning" target"="_blank"> Nissan 350Z</a> 
<!--if you're looking at this uh the link wasn't working so...-->
one of my proudest works. Many memories, good, mostly bad—and many hours in Zmodeler 3/ OpenIV. Honestly don't really miss it, but it probably the first time I was introducted to coding and writing stuff in files and all that good stuff. A few months ago I've made an Assetto corsa mod basing off from my own car.<br>

<h2>Back to Assetto Modding</h2>
	<p>I've met a good friend to help me along this journey. Since he's a server management expert, he needed my help to configure his dedicated server for use with Assetto. With my modding knowledge, we set up a startup server currently called North Ocean AC-Cutters. I'm also making him a car—an Audi R8—with as much detail as I can put into it. Our future goal is to create a community around the server and just have a great time.</p>
